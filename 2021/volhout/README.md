# Ten Line Sokoban (with Sprites)

By @Volhout

Volhout's entry was developed on the original Colour Maximite and the games engine was originally crunched into just 10 lines x 80 characters of MMBasic! Everything else is used to generate the sprites.

Three versions of the game are included:

 * `Sokoban-cmm1.bas` - original Colour Maximite version
 * `Sokoban-cmm2.bas` - minor changes to make Colour Maximite 2 compatible
 * `extra/Sokoban_Expanded.bas` - commented and uncrunched version of `Sokoban-cmm2.bas`

## Instructions

Use your man to push the green boxes onto the yellow crosses. You can only push the boxes, not pull them.
There are 20 levels. The level is shown in the left top corner.

**Controls:**

    [Cursor keys] - move
    [R]           - reload the current level
    [N]           - skip to next level (CMM2 version only)
