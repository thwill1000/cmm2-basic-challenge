
Dear Nimue,Tom,Mick,

Please find attached my final entry for the programming challenge: TLS.
After playing with it I was not happy with the result. Graphics where too small. Therefore a final update.

Despite the fact that the original 10 line sokoban was more impressive as a technical achievement (so much functionality in 10 lines) playing was not entertaining since it had only 2 levels.

Therefore my entry is this version, more detail, and 20 levels. 37 lines of 80 characters, for a CMM1 running version 4.5c MMBasic. I did not check if this still works on a CMM2 using OPTION LEGACY ON.

How to play:
Game task: move the green boxes onto the yellow crosses.
You (the Mario type guy) can only push the boxes, not pull.
Typing lower case "r" reloads the current level.
There are 20 levels. The level is shown in the left top corner.
Mario is controlled using cursor keys

Cheat: if you want to skip levels, add 1 line before the 34 lines that contains "w=your_next_level". The program will start at level 0, but pressing "r" will get you to this level.

The code is not very readable, but you may use this to help understand a bit.

' control by cursor keys-128 (128,129,130,131 => 0,1,2,3 => ^ V < >)
' playfield values 0=empty, 1=target, 2=block, 3=wall

'z   = size block
'x,y = position human
'e,g = new position human
'o,p = position onscreen
'n   = ascii value key
'b,c = direction human
'd   = done
'a$  = key pressed
'l,m = vars for decoding rooms
'i,j = counters
'k   = value field f(i,j)
'f() = playing field
't() = target locations for the boxes
's   = size playfield (sxs)
'q   = boolean (human on target)
'w   = level (0....nn)
'v$()= array to create sprites
'r$  = sprite color

Attached are the 37 lines in TLS_game.BAS

I would like to thank Vegipete and TassyJim for their suggestions.
I had a lot of fun creating this, may it give you fun playing...
Have fun....ðŸ˜€.
