This is a greatly compacted version of VegiPete's ChemiChaos game, restricted to
5 vials.

The object is to sort the vials so that all balls of the same color are in the
same vial. There are 10 rounds to play.

Three keys allow the user to play--

Spacebar (" ") picks the topmost ball from a vial, depending on where the arrow
cursor is, or, if a ball has already been picked, places the ball in the vial
below the cursor if there is space available and if the topmost ball is of the
same color as the "picked" one.

"1" moves the cursor to the left, if not already at the leftmost vial.

"2" moves the cursor to the right, if not already at the rightmost vial.

In addition, "z" restarts the current round, and "x" moves to the next round.

The game does not detect when the player has succeeded in sorting all balls. The
player must type "x" to move to the next round.
