The Green Hills Saga

On February 10, 2021, a contest was anounced on thebackshed.com

*****>>>  Colour Maximite 1 & 2 BASIC Programming Challenge 2021  <<<*****

<https://www.thebackshed.com/forum/ViewTopic.php?TID=13471&P=1>

Simply put, create a program that fits on a single editor page, the more
amazing, the better.

What fun!

I posted "In Defence of the Green Hills of Earth" the next day, a
clone of the classic game Space Invaders.

But I couldn't leave well enough alone so a month later, I posted
another One Page Wonder: "In Renewed Defense of the Green Hills",
this time something similar to Missile Command.

To round things off as the contest comes to a close, I have created a
third episode, "Escape to the Green Hills" in which the player must
navigate a maze. The alien command pyramid is hovering just above the
ground. Your job is to find and activate the self-destruct device. Others
have tried before you but apparently without success. We hope someone has
left a message for you. As far as we know, all levels except the first
one near the top, where we can infiltrate you, have an item of interest.
But beware! Some of those items are likely to be aliens, greenish blobs
according to reports. Destroy the pyramid to save the green hills, and
hopefully escape to tell the tale.

=============
In episode 1, use the arrow keys to move you ship left and right, and fire
with either Ctrl key.
> RUN "GreenHills1.bas"

In eposide 2, a mouse is required. The very first statement of the first
line sets the mouse port. Adjust this to match your system. "mp=0" means
use the built-in port available with 5.07.00bX
> RUN "GreenHills2.bas"

Episode 3 returns to keyboard control. Use the arrow keys to move and
turn. The space bar serves a purpose too. Also, "s" will take a
screen shot and save it on the SD card (overwriting any previous image.)
> RUN "GreenHills3.bas"

As an alternate, you can RUN "GreenHills3_SplashScreen.bas" to get a more
immersive introduction screen, although this version doesn't comply with
the contest rules.
