Greetings most honoured and exalted judges,

In order to prevent further injury to myself and thwill's poking finger, I am submitting the attached program, titled "Escape to the Green Hills".

=============

Part Three of the Green Hills Saga!
EscapeGreenHills800x600.jpg

To round things off as the contest comes to a close, I have created a
third episode, "Escape to the Green Hills" in which the player must
navigate a maze. The alien command pyramid is hovering just above the
ground. Your job is to find and activate the self-destruct device. Others
have tried before you but apparently without success. We hope someone has
left a message for you. As far as we know, all levels except the smallest
one near the top, where we can infiltrate you, have an item of interest.
But beware! Some of those items are likely to be aliens, greenish blobs
according to reports. Destroy the pyramid to save the green hills, and
hopefully escape out the bottom to tell the tale.

Run the program to play. Press any key to pass the title screen.
Use the arrow keys to move forward and backward and turn left and right.
The space bar will prove useful too.
If you find an object, move right to it to automatically interact with it.
Circular black holes in the floor lead to lower levels.

=============

Note: the entire trilogy is available in a ZIP file in my posting near the bottom
of page three of the contest thread on the BackShed
This includes all three episodes, expanded commented versions of the programs
and some extras such as a level generating program for part 3.

Enjoy and have fun!
