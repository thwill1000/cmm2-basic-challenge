Resistors

The marked tolerance value on resistors is only a guide. In actual fact,
resistors are selected on test for their tolerance after manufacture. It's
unlikely that you'll find, say, a 5% resistor that's within 1% of it's marked
value as those will have already been removed and sold as 1% resistors. Because
of this, a resistor actually has two likely value bands, one above it's marked
value and one below.

The enclosed program attempts to show these value bands, with a graphical
interface to set the value of the resistor. Simply move the band indicating
pointer using the B and M keys and press a key 0-9, S or G (silver or gold) to
set the band colour. The value information at the right hand side is updated
automatically.

The tolerance band will also show the more unusual closer tolerances that are
available, although only 1%, 5% and 10% are calculated here. Many old resistors
are 20% tolerance but this band hasn't been shown as it's unlikely to be of much
interest now.

The program illustrates quite nicely how unlikely it is that you'll find a
resistor that is exactly it's marked value.
