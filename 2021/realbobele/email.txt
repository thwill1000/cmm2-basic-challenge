Hi there :)

At first a big THANK YOU to bigmik and all of you to organize this fun little
contest. I am hanging around the forum for some time now (lurking, as you called
it), enjoying it very much, but did not write much yet, being a bit intimidated
by the technical brilliance and expertise of most of the members here. So I do
not hope for being able to win a teacup with my little game, but I am so curious
what the more capable programmers can do with 48 lines that I did not want to
have the second or third best not winning anything because of me being lazy and
not pushing up the number of entries. And bigmik going ultimately broke also is
worth the fun ;)

So here is my submission, "Iceberg", including a manual, as requested.

Thanks again and greetings from Germany
