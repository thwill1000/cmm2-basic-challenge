Developed by amateur radio enthusiasts, [SSTV (Slow-Scan Television)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-scan_television) is a transmission standard for sending video pictures over an audio channel. The early equipment consisted of analog electronics and picture tubes with storage capability and the earliest eye-catching application was by NASA who used it to send footage of the dark side of the moon. The Robot corporation was a company that influenced SSTV in the early days, since the early 1970â€™s they delivered encoders and decoders, and have contributed to the standard.
