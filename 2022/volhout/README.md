Dear judges,

Please find my entry for the programming challenge.
A Robot-8 SSTV decoder playground. The program is 4976 bytes in size.
There is some explanation in the document attached.

Playground means that this program represents my personal development and the software evolution for SSTV decoding on the PicoMiteVGA.
There are some tools, and 4 different picture decoding algorithms that can be tried.
Since most do not have amateur radio equipment, links are provided to a youtube stream that uses Robot-8 SSTV.

Breaking the challenge rules, a small interface circuit is needed to connect a laptop to the PicomiteVGA.

In case judges cannot build the interface circuit, a link to a youtube video is provided to show the program in operation.

Thank you for taking my entry into account.
