Stellar Battle in the Seven Green Hills Zone

by VegiPete for the 2022 MMBasic 5K Programming Challenge

A rendition of Stellar 7 and Battlezone, written in MMBasic
for the Colour Maximite 2 computer.

Included is:
SBSGHZv02.bas      - 5116 incredible bytes worth of indecipherable gobble-dee-gook

SBSGHZv02EXP.bas   - an expanded version of the actual entry, which, while still partially
                     compressed, is much more human readable.

SBSGHZv02MMB4W.bas - a slight modification of the expanded version with some minor
                     changes to work better with MMBasic for Windows.

A note about the file size: Linefeed characters must be removed to fall under
the 5K length limit. Opening the program with the CMM2 built in editor, then
resaving the program will add linefeeds, resulting in an oversized program.
You have been warned.
